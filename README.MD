#  Plunder 
#### An app creating an on-line marketplace for users that places a high value on the safety of users while they conduct their e-commerce transactions.

When developing the concept behind plunder, I thought about the endless possibilities that a service like Craigslist offers paired with my hesitance to utilize them.  I choose not to frequent Craigslist because I have heard too many stories about purchase arrangements leading to less than shady transactions.  I wanted to offer a similar service that placed a higher emphasis on providing safe places for the e-commerce transactions to take place.

#### This was a group project developed by:
* Matthew Marberry (myself)
* Marshall Simpson

## Core Features:

#### A persistent database that allows users to register and login to the Plunder server and upload a user icon image.

#### Post expansion where users can see more about the post, if they are interested they can open a map of suggested plunder spots based on the location of the post.

Throughout this project both Marshall and I ran into several challenges and hurdles, but we were able to work together to overcome these issues.  I'm going to speak about some of my personal struggles in regards to developing the Plunder App.

My two main struggles in developing this project were in regards to:
1. Google Maps Back End Integration.
2. JSON Webtokens for user database.
